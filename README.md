# 🚆 Multi-Transport Booking System in C++

This is a console-based C++ project that allows users to book tickets for **Railways**, **Flights**, and **Buses**. It features a structured, menu-driven approach with clear separation between each transport system using `structs`, `inheritance`, and standard containers like `vector` and `map`.

## 📌 Features

- 📍 Unified menu for booking across all transport types
- 🚉 Railway reservation using `structs`
- 🛫 Flight booking using `classes` and `inheritance`
- 🚌 Bus reservation using `vector` and `map`
- 🔢 Unique IDs and formatted ticket display
- 📁 Modular file structure (all in `project_final.cpp`)
